Description: standards-compliant, fast, light-weight and extensible window manager
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 Some of the things to look for in Openbox are:
 .
  * ICCCM and EWMH compliance!
  * Very fast
  * Chainable key bindings
  * Customizable mouse actions
  * Window resistance
  * Multi-head Xinerama support!
  * Pipe menus

Package: gnome-panel-control
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Replaces: openbox (<< 3.4.11.2)
Breaks: openbox (<< 3.4.11.2)
Description: command line utility to invoke GNOME panel run dialog/menu
 gnome-panel-control can be used to invoke the GNOME panel run or main
 menu from the command line.  This is originally a helper utility of openbox 
 since gnome-panel is no longer managing its own key bindings.
